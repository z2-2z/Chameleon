- [ ] add encoding to random string generation
- [ ] Correctness: tests + fuzzing
    - Fuzzing:
        - Generate a random set of nodes with names
        - Generate a random graph with adjacency matrix (ignore main diagonale)
        - For each node generate a random set of variables including
          the refs to other nodes from matrix
        - syntax should be valid, don't care about lexer bugs
        - if chameleon exits with 0: generated code must compile without warnings !
        - fuzz in release mode
        - purely generation based
        - exit as soon as crash is found
- [ ] Additional grammar stats ?
- [ ] add max depth in C code
    - as option in grammar (value must be >= 1, stored as u64, special value "unlimited" which is default)
    - unlimited = ULLONG_MAX
    - at start of generate set depth to 0
        - in debug mode check that depth is 0 after leaving root container
    - at beginning of each named struct, increase value
    - at end of each named struct, decrease value
    - optional: depth < limit && ...
    - repeats: extra branch: if depth >= limit then smallest elem of numberset else invoke numberset
    - bytearray: choose smallest length
