- [ ] add encoding to random string generation
- [ ] Correctness: tests + fuzzing
    - Fuzzing:
        - Generate a random set of nodes with names
        - Generate a random graph with adjacency matrix (ignore main diagonale)
        - For each node generate a random set of variables including
          the refs to other nodes from matrix
        - syntax should be valid, don't care about lexer bugs
        - if chameleon exits with 0: generated code must compile without warnings !
        - fuzz in release mode
        - purely generation based
        - exit as soon as crash is found
- [ ] Additional grammar stats ?
- [ ] Performance evaluation
