- [ ] add encoding to random string generation
- [ ] extra option numberset_scheduling that is only global. also scheduling -> oneof_scheduling
- [ ] Correctness: tests + fuzzing
- [ ] Additional grammar stats ?
- [ ] names of structs may not collide with keywords
- [ ] add max depth in C code
    - as option in grammar (value must be >= 1, stored as u64, special value "unlimited" which is default)
    - unlimited = ULLONG_MAX
    - at start of generate set depth to 0
        - in debug mode check that depth is 0 after leaving root container
    - at beginning of each named struct, increase value
    - at end of each named struct, decrease value
    - optional: depth < limit && ...
    - repeats: extra branch: if depth >= limit then smallest elem of numberset else invoke numberset
    - bytearray: choose smallest length
